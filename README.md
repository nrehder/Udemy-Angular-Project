## Features:

Course design was a recipe book saved to a realtime database.  Code found here implements NgRx to store data locally.  Issues I had with the design, the shopping list is not saved to the database and all users access the same data.

Prior to the NgRx portion of the course, I changed the database to store the users data based on their email address, as well as saving the shopping list.  A working example of that can be found: https://udemy-angular-project-60e63.web.app/
